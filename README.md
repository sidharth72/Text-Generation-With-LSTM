# Text Generation With LSTM Neural Network Using TensorFlow.

Text generation is getting much attention lately due to its generality and the various use cases it offers. LSTMs are widely used for text generation later becoming unpopular since the introduction of Transformers, but still, LSTM and other types of RNNs like GRU are used in the realm of NLP. This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for trainining an LSTM network from scratch to generate text.
